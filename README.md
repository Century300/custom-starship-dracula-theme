## 📦 Installation Guide

### **1️⃣ Install [Starship](https://starship.rs/) cross-shell prompt**
- Global:
```bash
curl -sS https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh
```

- Homebrew (macOS):
```bash
brew install starship
```

- Powershell (Windows)
```bash
Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
```

- Ubuntu
```bash
sudo snap install --edge starship
echo 'export STARSHIP_CONFIG="$HOME/snap/starship/common/starship.toml"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### **2️⃣ Install a Nerd Font**
To display icons properly, install a Nerd Font from https://www.nerdfonts.com/, such as FiraCode Nerd Font, then change your terminal font manually.
- For Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Fedora, Kali, and most distros), install FiraCode Nerd Font with:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts && cd ~/.local/share/fonts && wget -O FiraCode.zip https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/FiraCode.zip && unzip -o FiraCode.zip -d FiraCode && rm FiraCode.zip && fc-cache -fv

```
- For macOS, use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

### **3️⃣ Apply my custom Starship Dracula Theme**
- I used the color coding from the [Dracula Starship GitHub
](https://github.com/dracula/starship/blob/9f2c60b5e6de26e340d8d91ba6c4a725e56d6992/starship.toml) and added my own configurations. You can manually copy my starship.toml source code to ~/.config/starship.toml or download it via:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Century300/custom-starship-dracula-theme/main/starship.toml -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```

- Occasionally, especially on macOS, Starship may fail to automatically add the required initialization line to `~/.zshrc`. If your prompt does not reflect the Starship theme, you may need to manually add the following line at the bottom of `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# starship theme https://starship.rs/
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```
- If you install Starship via Snap in Ubuntu, move the config file to: $HOME/snap/starship/common/starship.toml.

- Apply changes:
```bash
exec zsh
```

### 📂 Folder Path Display (Truncation)
By default, this theme displays the full folder path in most cases.
However, if the path contains more than 20 folders, it will be truncated, showing only the last 20 folders.
If you prefer a shorter path, you can change truncation_length to 3 to only display the last 3 folders:
```toml
# Stylish Directory
[directory]
format = "(purple)【📂 [$path]($style)】(purple)"
style = "bold purple"
truncation_length = 20
truncation_symbol = "…/"
```
